This is a Hospital Recommender system that takes the person's current location, gets the basic details of the person and makes a report for the doctor to review. The location information is used to fetch the lattitude and longitude details and compute the nearest hospital accordingly. 

Future improvements:
- Fetching the details of the doctors, their appointments and availablility and developing this project into a Hospital Appointment Booking system
- Creating a separate facility for urgent cases such as Accidents, ect.
